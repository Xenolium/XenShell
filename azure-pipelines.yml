# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# Script for Windows
pool: { vmImage: windows-2019 } # or whatever pool you use
steps:
- checkout: none
- powershell: |
    $SEARCH_PATH=$Env:Path
    Write-Host "##[debug] Found directories"
    ForEach ($Dir in $SEARCH_PATH -split ";") {
      Write-Host "$Dir"
    }
    Write-Host ""
    Write-Host ""
    Write-Host "##[debug] Found files"
    ForEach ($Dir in $SEARCH_PATH -split ";") {
      Get-ChildItem $Dir -File -ErrorAction Continue | ForEach-Object -Process {
